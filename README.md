Teacup Offline
==============

This is an offline-first version of Teacup, for posting food and drink posts to your website via Micropub.

You can bookmark this to your home screen to install it as an app, and you'll be able to launch it even with no internet connection. Creating a post will save the post first to the device, and when it comes back online it will sync all saved posts to your Micropub endpoint.

To set this up, go into the settings and paste in your Micropub endpoint and access token. (IndieAuth support coming later)
